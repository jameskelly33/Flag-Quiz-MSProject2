The primary goal of this site is to provide a fun and informative interactive quiz to test a userâ€™s knowledge of country flags, giving users the opportunity to test their knowledge in three levels of difficulty. 

## **UX**

### *User goals*

The central audience for this site is people who would like to test their knowledge of flags or people who would like to learn more.

This site will meet these goals because

*   The site will be fully interactive and click based, not reuiring any typing or spelling.
*   The quiz is available in three difficulty levels to suit different levels of prior knowledge.
*   Quizes are randomised meaning that no one 30second will ever be in the same order or with the same multiple choice in order to encourage users to replay and improve their skills.
*   Quizes will be timed at 30 seconds maximum meaning users do not have to make any long time commitments. 
*   A users will be able to save and track their score and compare it to other users. 
*   Visual feedback will be give to help users learn from their mistakes. 



## **Wireframes**

### **User Story**

As a user who would like to play a flag trivia quiz, I want:

1. An uncomplicated user interface which allows quick and initituve interaction.
2. Clear and easy to understand feedback.
3. The option to play a quiz that is suited to my knowledge level.
4. Recognition of my positive achievements.
5. Encouragement to continue playing in order to get better. 

**Design Choices**

The overall design of the site is based on a single page , no scrolling layout, with mimumum text. Questions, answers and user-feedback are designed and presented as visually as possible with a bare-minimum of typing requried(only to enter your name if a user would like to save their score)


* **Font**
Their is only one font used throughout the quiz which is ..... This font was chosen for its visually cliarty and abiltiy to stand out on the page especilaly in it's heavier weights. 


* **Colours**

The main consideration behind the color pallete of this site is having a primary background color that does not clash with the flag. Color is obviosuly very important in distinguishing flags and a background color that is close to the white or red end of the spectrum would cause a lot of problems due to the hihg prevelance of those colors in world flags. As this site is aimed at front-end interactive the buttons which a user presses needed to be of a signifcant contrast to the backgcournd as a call to action. Considering these factors, the follwoing color palette was created using the generator in [Colormind](http://colormind.io/bootstrap/) See this website for flag color statistics. [Statistics on flag Colors](https://www.crwflags.com/fotw/flags/xf-csts.html). Red and green are used throughout the site for negative and positive feedback (for incorrect/correct and for time running out and scoring )  in order to create a  quick and text-free way of passing information on to the user. 


## **Features**

### **Existing Features**


### **Homepage**

* The homepage has a main title which reads Flag Quiz, a sub-heading asking the user 'How well do you know the flags of the world?' and a final line of text inviting the user to choose a difficulty level.
* Below the text are three large buttons with the three levels of difficulty, easy, medium and difficult. 
* Upon clicking on one of the buttons the quiz will start. 

### **Main Quiz Page**  

**Header**

* Along the top of the page the question number, score, countdown timer and a close button are evenly spread out. 
* If the user selects the correct answer the score information will flash green as it increases.
* When the user has only 10 seconds remaining the timer will start to flash red. 
* Upon clicking the close button the timer will pause and a modal will appear to ask the user if they are sure they want to quit the quiz or if they want to return to the game.

 **Flag**

* A flag appears centered below the header and will change every time a user selects and answer until the time runs out. 
* For mobile, tablet and laptop screen sizes the flags all have a fixed height and variable widths depending on the ratios of each flag. On larger screens the flags have a fixed width and variable height as the API does not allow for fixed height flags larger thatn 240pixels. 

**Answer buttons**

* Below the flags are four large buttons, each with the name of a different country.
* If the user selects the correct answer for the displayed flag, the button's color will change to green and the next question will appear after 1 second.
* If the user selects an incorrect answer for the displayed flag, the selected button's background will change to red and the correct answer will be highlighted in green for 1 second until the next question appears. **

### **Scorepage**

* The default scorepage shows a message giving the user their total score and how many questions they answered in the 30 second time-limit
* If the user made msitakes, thumbnails of the flags they guessed incorrectly will appear with the correct answers below them. 
* There are two buttons below, one allowing the user to save their score, which when clicked will activate a modal prompting the user to enter their name.
* After the user has entered their name a table will appear showing the names and scores of all site users.
* The second button on the scorepage is a play again button which will take the user back to homepage allowing them to play a new game.
