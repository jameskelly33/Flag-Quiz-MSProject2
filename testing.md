## **Testing User Stories from User Experience (UX) Section**


As a user of this site, I want:

1. An uncomplicated user interface which allows quick and intuitive interaction.
    * The design of the site allows for simple navigation from one section to the next all via clearly defined and contrasted buttons. 
    * The user can start the quiz through just one click.
    * Answers are chosen by click only, allowing the user to go through the questions as quickly as they like without worrying about typing, spelling etc.

2. Clear and easy to understand feedback.
    * The user receives instant feedback for each question by a green background on the correct answer and a red background on the selected incorrect answer.
    * The user also sees the score instantly update and flash green every time they get an answer correct.
    * Once the quiz has been completed the users score is prominently displayed along with any errors they have made.

3. The option to play a quiz that is suited to my knowledge level.
    * The user has the chance to choose from three levels, easy, medium and difficult and does not have to play them in any order and is free to choose between them.
    
    

4. Recognition of my positive achievements.
    * The user is given the opportunity to save their score along with their name to add to the high score table where they can compare with other users or their previous scores. 
    * The user is rewarded for choosing a harder difficulty by achieving higher points for correctly guessing less well-recognised flags. 

5. Encouragement to continue playing in order to get better. 
    * In game feedback is given when the user chooses an incorrect answer as well as a visual summary of all the flag the user di not guess correctly, allowing them to make a mental note of any new or unfamilar flags for them. 
    * Within a couple of clicks a user can restart a brand new game, and althought the flags stay the same for each difficulty level, they will never appear in same order or with the same answer options allowing a unique experince no matter how many times they play the game.
